            <li><span class="category">Personal background:</span>Grew up in NM, then school in DC, grad school in VA, moved to Charlotte for work around '97. CPCC since '01. Seven kids, 4 cats, a fish, and a Gekko...</li>
            <li><span class="category">Professional: </span>blah blah</li>
            <li><span class="category">Academic background: </span>BSLA, MS/MIS, lots of training - i mean lots. Worked in everything from Ski Instruction to Movie theaters, but more recently as a consultant and teacher. I do a lot of conference presentations and professional workshops, and teach in a couple of different places along with my full-time work at CPCC. Information/Technology background: Started with macs in early 90's, then on to PC's in grad school, and now just see 'em all as tools. I want them to do the job, and don't care about much else. I see computers as magnifications of possibilities.</li>
            <li><span class="category">Background in the subject matter of this course:</span>I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!</li>
            <li><span class="category">Primary Computer Platform:</span>Windows 7-10 at home and work, though I just got a mac laptop to play with.</li>

                I donated my body to science in school to earn money - in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always wonder...</li>
            <li><span class="category">I'd also like to share:</span>
